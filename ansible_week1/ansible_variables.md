- few `examples` which will show `various ways` in which the `variables` can be `used` with `Ansible`

- this is being designed so that it can be used `within` your `own project`

- in this lecture we have the `shell script` which will show the `directory` and `result` of the execution 

- we can go to the `Ansible PlayBooks, Introduction` &rarr; `Ansible Playbooks, Variables` 

- in the `Ansible Playbooks, Variables` we have the `show_example.sh` shell script file
