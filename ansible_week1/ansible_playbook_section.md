# <ins> Ansible Playbooks, Breakdown of Sections </ins> #

- as we have the understanding of `YAML` now we can start looking into the `creation of ansible playbook`

- we will discuss the `common section` that we have in the `ansible playbook`

- we will go through the `sections` and `use` this section `sectons` for creating the `mmessage of the day` ansible `playbook` on the `centos os target hosts`

- we will see the `use of the variable`

- how to `manipulate the variable` by using the `command line`

- how to use `handlers` for `post task execution`

- how to `update` the `playbook` so that it can `target` `our ubuntu hosts` alongside the `centos target hosts` in a `dynamic way` with the use of `when` keyword `declarative directive` by `leveraging` the `facts` about the `system` to `derive` `when` the `distribution` is `ubuntu and centos`

- we can go to the `Ansible Playbooks, Breakdown of Sections` can go to the `01/templates` folder
